## The Core Rule

Use HTML for meaning and OCS classes for reusable layout or component roles. This example shows how an OCS class gives a paragraph a defined role.

**Ideate:** 
* **HMW Question:** How might we teach students to trust global SASS styles and stop hardcoding text appearance? 
* **Activity:** Refactoring a poorly written HTML snippet into clean, semantic HTML that automatically inherits our SASS theme.

**Prototype & Test:** I taught a trial run to my project team. They felt the original homework was too long, so I revised it to be a single, focused refactoring task (documented below).

## 2. Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** By the end of this lesson, you will be able to structure text using semantic HTML tags so it automatically inherits our global SASS typography styles without using custom classes. 

**Success Criteria:** You can take an unformatted block of text, apply the correct headings, paragraphs, and list tags, and have it match our site's design system perfectly.

### Tech Talk (3 minutes)
We are using a global SASS typography system. This means **you don't need to write CSS for your text**. Instead of styling text to look a certain way, you just need to tell the browser *what* the text is. There’s already a global system to take care of the styling.

* **The Rule:** Use semantic HTML tags. Let the system handle the look.
* ✅ **Do this:** `<h1>Main Heading</h1>` or `<strong>Important</strong>`
* ❌ **Don't do this:** `<div class="title-text">Main Heading</div>` or `<p class="bold">Important</p>`

Why do we do this? It ensures our whole project looks consistent, makes our code cleaner, and is essential for screen readers and SEO.

### Supported Tags Reference Guide

Before we jump into the examples, here is a quick cheat sheet of the tags we use to build our visual hierarchy. 

| Tag | Purpose | Usage Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `<h1>` | Page title | Used once per page (top-level heading) |
| `<h2>` | Section titles | Major sections within a page |
| `<h3>` | Sub-sections or card headers | Grouping inside `<h2>` sections |
| `<h4>` | Minor headings | Optional for smaller sub-sections |
| `<p>` | Paragraphs and body content | Default for most content text |
| `<strong>` | Emphasis or importance | Highlights key words/phrases |
| `<em>` | Subtle emphasis or tone shift | Used for soft emphasis (like italics) |
| `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` | Lists | Use for bullets or ordered items |

### Code Examples

**1. Simple: Basic Headings and Paragraphs**
```html
<h2>OCS Typography</h2>
<p class="ocs__lead">Use semantic HTML and OCS classes to structure your page.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose HTML elements for meaning.</li>
  <li>Use OCS classes for reusable visual roles.</li>
</ol>
```

### Semantic HTML

Use meaningful HTML elements to structure content clearly and accessibly.

| Element | Meaning | OCS usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<h1>` | Page-level heading | Use for the page's primary title. The frontmatter title is the only h1 in Markdown or notebook content. |
| `<h2>` | Major section heading | Use for main sections |
| `<h3>` | Subsection heading | Use inside an `<h2>` section or card |
| `<p>` | Paragraph | Use for normal body text |
| `<strong>` | Important content | Use when the meaning is important, not just when text should look bold |
| `<em>` | Stressed content | Use when emphasis changes the meaning or tone |
| `<ul>` | Unordered list | Use when item order does not matter |
| `<ol>` | Ordered list | Use for steps, rankings, or sequences |
| `<li>` | List item | Must be inside `<ul>` or `<ol>` |

### OCS Typography Grammar

Use OCS classes to express roles without hardcoded visual styling.

| Rule | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `ocs__description` | Introductory or supporting description text |
| `ocs__text` | Standard body text inside an OCS component |
| `ocs__lead` | Larger introductory paragraph |
| `ocs__section-title` | Section or card heading |
| `ocs__badge` | Small contextual label |
| `ocs__status` | State or status indicator |
| `ocs__card` | Framed content panel |
| `ocs__visual` | Supporting visual or fact panel |

## 1. LxD Cycle Process

**Empathize:** I noticed a lot of students try to manually style text using custom classes (like `<p class="big-bold">Main Heading</p>`) instead of letting the global SASS theme handle it through proper HTML structure. This breaks our site's visual consistency and messes up accessibility.

**Define:**

* **POV:** CSP students need a way to build web pages using semantic HTML because relying on manual CSS classes creates messy code and inaccessible design.
* **Learning Goal:** Students will understand how to use global SASS typography styling by applying the correct semantic HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, etc.) instead of custom classes.

**Ideate:**

* **HMW Question:** How might we teach students to trust global SASS styles and stop hardcoding text appearance?
* **Activity:** Refactoring a poorly written HTML snippet into clean, semantic HTML that automatically inherits our SASS theme.

**Prototype & Test:** I taught a trial run to my project team. They felt the original homework was too long, so I revised it to be a single, focused refactoring task (documented below).

### Code Examples

#### A. Simple: Basic Headings and Paragraphs

```html
<!-- We use h1 for the single page title, h2 for major sections, and p for body text. -->
<h1>About Our Project</h1>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>We are a group of CSP students building a cool web app.</p>
```

#### B. Intermediate: Adding Emphasis

```html
<!-- Don't use bold or italics classes. Use semantic meaning. -->
<p>You <strong>must</strong> commit your code daily.</p>
<p>It is <em>highly recommended</em> to leave comments.</p>
```

#### C. Complex: Full Section Structure

```html
<!-- Grouping content properly using hierarchy -->
<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.9+</li>
  <li>VS Code</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repo.</li>
  <li>Run the setup script.</li>
</ol>
```

## 3. Hacks & Practice Tasks

### Prepare your submission IPYNB

Complete this quick-start flow so you can begin in about 2 minutes.

1. Create a new notebook in your portfolio homework area: `_notebooks/homework`.
2. Add one markdown cell at the top with the frontmatter below.
3. Add code cells for Popcorn and Homework. Keep the `%%html` and `UI_RUNNER` comment in each code cell.
4. Run each cell and verify the rendered output before submitting.

### Submission Safety Rules (Read First)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid grading errors, follow these rules exactly:
>
> * Submit only your final semantic HTML for each hack.
> * Do not add custom CSS, inline styles, or extra classes.
> * Keep `%%html` and the `UI_RUNNER` comment line in each submission cell.
> * Use only allowed semantic tags for this lesson: `h1`-`h4`, `p`, `ul`/`ol`/`li`, `strong`, `em`.
> * For this notebook assignment, treat your notebook content as the student artifact, while site pages still reserve the single top-level h1 for frontmatter title.

### Popcorn Hack (In-Class)

> [!TIP]
> 2-minute challenge: refactor and run, then paste only your corrected code in chat.

**Task:** Look at the bad code below. Replace non-semantic elements with semantic tags and run it with UI_RUNNER.

```html
%%html
<style>
    .large-title {
        font-size: 32px;
        font-weight: bold;
        line-height: 1.6;
        font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
    }
    .sub-title {
        font-size: 24px;
        line-height: 1.6;
        font-weight: bold;
        font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
    }
    .body-text {
        font-size: 16px;
        line-height: 1.6;
        font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
    }
    .bold {
        font-weight: bold;
        line-height: 1.6;
    }
</style>


<!-- UI_RUNNER: Typography Popcorn Base--> 
<div class="large-title">Welcome!</div>
<span class="sub-title">Read this</span>
<div class="body-text">This is a sentence.</div>
<div class="bold">This is bolded text.</div>
```

**Expected direction:** one heading, one supporting heading/subheading, one paragraph, and one bolded sentence, without anything extra.

### Homework Hack

**Task:** Refactor the following code block. Remove all custom classes and replace them with the correct semantic HTML tags (`h1`-`h4`, `p`, `ul`/`ol`/`li`, `strong`, `em`) so it uses our Aesthetihawk SASS theme. Run with UI_RUNNER, then submit the clean HTML in your notebook.

```html
%%html

<!-- UI_RUNNER: Typography Homework Base --> 
<p class="large-title">Project Features</p>
<p class="sub-title">User Accounts</p>
<p class="body-text">Users can make an account and log in. This is a <span class="bold">crucial</span> feature.</p>
<p class="body-text">Steps to register:</p>
<p class="list-item">1. Click register</p>
<p class="list-item">2. Enter email</p>
<p class="list-item">3. Set password</p>
```

## 4. Grading Plan (1 Point Total)

### Classroom Rubric

* **0.2 points: Popcorn completion**
  Student submitted a semantic refactor attempt and kept the code runnable with `%%html`.
* **0.8 points: Homework completion**
  * **0.4 heading and paragraph semantics:** Uses heading hierarchy correctly and keeps descriptive text in paragraphs.
  * **0.3 list semantics:** Converts fake numbered paragraph lines into one real ordered list (`<ol>` with three `<li>` items).
  * **0.1 emphasis semantics:** Converts purely visual emphasis to semantic emphasis (`<strong>` or `<em>`).

### Quick Validation Checklist


* Present: `%%html` and `UI_RUNNER` comment line.
* Absent: class attributes, inline style attributes, and span-based fake emphasis.
* Present: at least one heading tag, paragraph tags, ordered list tags, and list item tags.
* Present: semantic emphasis tag for the word that was previously marked as visually important.

## 5. Lesson Revisions & Feedback Evidence

* **Feedback Received:** During my peer practice run, my teammate pointed out that my original Popcorn Hack asked them to write a whole HTML page from scratch, which took longer than 5 minutes and killed the lesson's momentum.
* **Revision Made:** I changed the Popcorn Hack to a simple 3-line refactor that they can do directly in the chat window. This keeps engagement high and takes under 2 minutes.
